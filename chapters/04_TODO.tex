\chapter{What's next}

The following chapters are still in the works:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \CC20 ranges in depth
    \item \CC20 views
    \item writing your own algorithm, writing your own view
    \item parallel algorithms and beyond the \CC standard library
    \item iterator adapters
    \item numerical conversions and promotions (relates to numerical algorithms)
    \item \CC23 features
\end{itemize}

% TODO: Note algorithms that in their range versions only use projection for the functor, not for the output range, such as copy_if.
% TODO: Some views were covered in the transformation chapter re-review.
