\chapter{Preface}

This book will not start with a personal story or some other flowery recollections. Instead, to protect your time, I will lay out precisely what this book is about and who am I to be qualified to write this book. Hopefully, this will help you decide whether reading this book is a good use of your time.

\section*{About this book}

This book is a complete guide to the C++ standard algorithms. However, that might not mean much to you, so let me unpack this statement.

This book is a guide, as opposed to a reference, meaning that instead of describing every detail, the book concentrates on examples and pointing out notable, surprising, dangerous or interesting aspects of the different algorithms. Furthermore, unlike a reference, it is supposed to be read, for the most part, like a book in sequential order.

C++ already has one canonical reference, the C++ standard, and for quick lookup, the \url{cppreference.com} wiki is a great source.

The "complete" part of the statement refers to the width of coverage. The book covers all algorithms and relevant theory up to the C++20 standard (the C++23 standard is not finalized at the time of writing). All information is present only in sufficient depth required by the context. This depth limitation keeps the book's overall size reasonable and within the "guide" style.

\section*{About the author}

So, hi, I am Šimon Tóth, the sole author of this book. My primary qualification is 20 years of C++ experience, with approximately 15 of those years C++ being my primary language in professional settings.

My main background is HPC, spanning academia, big tech and startup environments. I have architected, built and operated systems of all scales, from single machine hardware supported high-availability to planet-scale services.\footnote{You can check my LinkedIn profile at \url{cz.linkedin.com/in/simontoth} for a detailed view of my past career.}

Throughout my career, my passion has always been teaching and mentoring junior engineers, which is why you are now reading this book.
